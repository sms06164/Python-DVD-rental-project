            "Passage from https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/alzheimers-drug-promise-approval-1.6908896:\n",
            "Another experimental Alzheimer's drug can modestly slow patients' inevitable worsening — by about four to seven months, researchers reported Monday.Eli Lilly and Co. is seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of donanemab. If cleared, it would be only the second Alzheimer's treatment convincingly shown to delay the mind-robbing disease, after the recently approved Leqembi from Japanese drugmaker Eisai.\"Finally there's some hope, right, that we can talk about,\" Lilly's Dr. John Sims told reporters Monday at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Amsterdam.\"We don't cure the disease,\" he said. \"Diabetes doesn't have a cure either. It doesn't mean you can't have very meaningful treatments for patients.\"Lilly announced in May that donanemab appeared to work, but on Monday the full results of a study of 1,700 patients were published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) and presented at the Alzheimer's conference.This image provided by Eisai in January shows vials and packaging for its Alzheimer's medication Leqembi. On Monday, Eli Lilly and Co. released data from its study of 1,700 patients showing its Alzheimer's drug, donanemab, also slows progression of the disease. (Eisai/The Associated Press)Both donanemab and Leqembi are lab-made antibodies, administered by IV, that target one Alzheimer's culprit: sticky amyloid buildup in the brain. Both drugs come with a serious safety concern — brain swelling or bleeding that in the Lilly study was linked to three deaths.Leqembi and donanemab are not approved in Canada. In an email to CBC News, a Health Canada spokesperson said that Leqembi is listed as under review on the agency's new drug submission website. The drug's application was accepted for review in May. Health Canada says it doesn't comment on drugs that are under review, and that timing of these submissions depends on many factors, including a need for more data, talks with the sponsor and requirements for updates to safety information. Meanwhile, donanemab has not been submitted for review, according to Health Canada's website.  The Alzheimer Society of Canada's CEO Christopher Barry told CBC News in an email that the society is \"hopeful that new advancements in research will bring more treatment options to Canadians.\"Barry added that long-term trial data will be crucial in understanding the risks and benefits for people living with dementia. Questions remain about which patients will benefitScientists say while these drugs may mark a new era in Alzheimer's therapy, huge questions remain about which patients should try them and how much benefit they'll really notice.\"The modest benefits would likely not be questioned by patients, clinicians or payers if amyloid antibodies were low risk, inexpensive and simple to administer. However, they are none of these,\" Dr. Eric Widera, of the University of California, San Francisco, wrote in a JAMA editorial accompanying Lilly's new data.Lilly's study enrolled people aged 60 to 85 who were in early stages of Alzheimer's. Half received once-a-month infusions of donanemab and half got dummy infusions for 18 months.Alzheimer's drug Leqembi has full FDA approval in the U.S. now and that means Medicare will pay for it2nd clinical trials for promising Alzheimer's drug to take place at U of Sask.The study had a few twists. Patients were switched to dummy infusions if enough amyloid cleared out — something that happened to about half within a year.And because amyloid alone doesn't cause Alzheimer's, researchers also tracked levels of another culprit in the brain — abnormal tau. More tau signals more advanced disease.The results: both groups declined during the 18-month study, but overall, those given donanemab worsened about 22 per cent more slowly. Some patients fared better — those with low to medium tau levels saw a 35 per cent slower decline, reflecting that the drug appears to work better in earlier stages of the disease.WATCH | New Alzheimer's drug Leqembi met with hope and caution:Hope and anxiety surround new Alzheimer’s drug lecanemab8 months agoDuration 3:43Two pharmaceutical companies say a drug they’ve developed has the potential to slow the progression of Alzheimer’s, something no treatment has been able to do. Now, researchers and those impacted by the disease are anxiously awaiting the full results of a human trial for the medication.Drug slows disease progression by 4 to 7 monthsHow much difference does that make? It means donanemab slowed patients' worsening by about four to seven months, the JAMA report concluded.Another way of measuring: among the donanemab recipients with lower tau levels, 47 per cent were considered stable a year into the study compared with 29 per cent of those who got the dummy version.The main safety concern is brain swelling or bleeding, which often causes no symptoms but sometimes can be serious, even fatal. About a quarter of donanemab recipients showed evidence of that swelling, and about 20 per cent had microbleeds.Scientists already know that patients getting any amyloid-targeted therapy need repeat brain scans to check for those side effects — a costly and time-consuming hurdle.Widera noted that the possibility of stopping donanemab treatment at least temporarily in people who respond well would help limit some of those challenges. For comparison, Leqembi is given by IV every two weeks and researchers didn't test a similar stoppage.It's too soon to know if some patients might need to resume donanemab, said Lilly's Dr. Mark Mintun.But the amyloid \"doesn't come back with any sort of vengeance,\" he said, speculating that might take several years.Canada's health-care system 'not ready,' expert saysNeurologist Carmela Tartaglia, with the University Health Network's Krembil Brain Institute in Toronto, told CBC News that while the findings are \"very promising,\" it's important people know that it's not a \"miracle\" and \"doesn't stop the disease altogether.\"But the delay it creates, Tartaglia said, can give people some extra time with a loved one. \"Keeping people out of nursing homes is very much clinically meaningful for our patients,\" she said. \"Even if it's only six months — and that seems like not that much for us in the bigger scheme of a lifetime — six months extra with a loved one is actually hugely meaningful for many of our patients and their families.\" She said this drug still comes with its limitations, however, such as whether the plaque will eventually return after patients stop the medication. When it comes to the future of a drug like this in Canada, Tartaglia suggested our health system is \"not ready\" for this type of treatment. People approved for the drug need to be specifically diagnosed and tested, they'll need to get infusions and will then need to be monitored with constant MRIs — all of this, she said, can't be handled by our current health-care system. \"I think the drugs have shown their efficacy,\" she said. \"The problem is to get the right drug to the right person at the right time; the infrastructure in [the] Canadian health care system has to change.\"Lack of diversity in studyAnother concern with the study on donanemab is that more than 90 per cent of its participants were white, leaving little data about how other populations might respond, Alzheimer's specialist Jennifer Manly, of Columbia University, wrote in JAMA.Scientists have long tried and failed to slow Alzheimer's with amyloid-targeting drugs — and the FDA's contentious 2021 conditional approval of a drug named Aduhelm soon fizzled amid lack of evidence that it really worked. The approval of Leqembi and promising data for donanemab have reignited interest in attacking amyloid buildup.But Mintun acknowledged additional approaches are needed, saying Lilly expects results of a late-stage study of a tau-fighting drug next year.\n",

            "The World Health Organization said more than two dozen cats have been infected with bird flu across Poland, but no people appeared to have been sickened.In a statement on Monday, the UN health agency said it was the first time so many cats had been reported to have bird flu over such a wide geographical area in a single country, amid an unprecedented global outbreak of the latest version of the H5N1 version of the disease.WHO said that late last month, Polish authorities informed agency officials of the unusual deaths of more than 45 cats in 13 geographical regions of the country. Testing last week found that 29 had H5N1.As of June, the most recent variant of H5N1 has been reported in birds and other animal species in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. Since 2020, WHO said a dozen human cases have been reported.Scientists worry that rising cases of H5N1, particularly in animals that have frequent contact with humans, might lead to a mutated version of the disease that could spread easily between people, triggering another pandemic.Before the COVID-19 pandemic, many experts had suspected that the next global outbreak would be sparked by H5N1.But while bird flu has killed hundreds of millions of birds globally, it has sickened fewer than 900 people since 2003 and has not been able to spread easily among humans.Sask. scientists developing vaccines to protect birds and humans from avian fluNew avian flu virus subtype found in P.E.I. birds and raccoonsWHO said it was unclear how the domestic cats in Poland became infected with bird flu and said officials were still investigating possible sources of exposure, including contact with wild birds that are known to carry H5N1.The agency said the risk of people in Poland being infected with bird flu was \"low\" and \"low to moderate\" for people exposed to cats, including cat owners and veterinarians.Last week, WHO and partners warned that the increasing numbers of mammals infected with H5N1 were unusual. Experts have previously cautioned that pigs, which are susceptible to flu viruses from both humans and birds, might act as a \"mixing vessel,\" leading to the emergence of mutated viruses that could be lethal to people.Cape St. Mary's birds were decimated by last year's avian flu, and the reserve fears a repeat in 2023Since last year, authorities in 10 countries have reported bird flu outbreaks in mammals, including farmed mink in Spain, seals in the U.S., and sea lions in Peru and Chile.\n",

            "Federal regulators on Thursday approved the nation's first over-the-counter birth control pill in a landmark decision that will soon allow American women and girls to obtain contraceptive medication as easily as they buy aspirin and eye drops.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared once-a-day Opill to be sold without a prescription, making it the first such medication to be moved out from behind the pharmacy counter. The manufacturer, Ireland-based Perrigo, won't start shipping the pill until early next year, and there will be no age restrictions on sales.Hormone-based pills have long been the most common form of birth control in the U.S., used by tens of millions of women since the 1960s. Until now, all of them required a prescription.Medical societies and women's health groups have pushed for wider access for decades, noting that an estimated 45 per cent of the six million annual pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended. Teens and girls, women of colour and those with low incomes report greater hurdles in getting prescriptions and picking them up.The challenges can include paying for a doctor's visit, getting time off from work and finding child care.\"This is really a transformation in access to contraceptive care,\" said Kelly Blanchard, president of Ibis Reproductive Health, a non-profit group that supported the approval. \"Hopefully this will help people overcome those barriers that exist now.\"Perrigo says Opill could be an important new option for the estimated 15 million U.S. women who currently use no birth control or less effective methods, such as condoms. They are a fifth of women who are child-bearing age.Price to be announced later this yearBut how many women will actually gain access depends on the medication's price, which Perrigo plans to announce later this year.\"The reason why so many of us worked tirelessly for years to get over-the-counter birth control pills is to improve access … cost shouldn't be one of those barriers,\" said Dr. Pratima Gupta of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.Most older birth control pills cost $15 to $30 for a month's supply without insurance coverage. Over-the-counter medicines are generally much cheaper than prescriptions, but they typically aren't covered by insurance.Forcing insurers to cover over-the-counter birth control would require a regulatory change by the federal government, which women's advocates are urging the Biden administration to implement.This file photo shows the U.S. Food & Drug Administration campus in Silver Spring, Md.  (Andrew Harnik/ Associated Press)The FDA approval gives U.S. women another birth control option amid the legal and political battles over reproductive health, including last year's reversal of Roe v. Wade, which has upended abortion access across the U.S.That said, Opill's approval is unrelated to the ongoing court battles over the abortion pill mifepristone.And anti-abortion groups have generally emphasized that they do not oppose contraceptives, which are used to prevent pregnancies, not end them.However, that has done little to ease fears that contraception could someday become a target. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a separate opinion in which he explicitly called on his colleagues to put the high court's same-sex marriage, gay sex and contraception cases on the table.In the last year, the FDA has faced pressure from Democratic politicians, health advocates and medical professionals to improve access to birth control. The American Medical Association and other leading medical groups backed Opill's application for over-the-counter status.Birth control pills are available without a prescription across much of South America, Asia and Africa.WATCH | B.C. will offer free birth control. Will the rest of Canada follow? B.C. will offer free birth control. Will the rest of Canada follow? | About That4 months agoDuration 10:10Starting April 1, British Columbia will offer residents free prescription birth control. Andrew Chang is joined by Dr. Ruth Habte, an OB-GYN resident, to discuss whether the rest of Canada will follow suit.Some FDA scientists concerned about pill Perrigo submitted years of research to the FDA to show that women could understand and follow instructions for using the pill.Thursday's approval came despite some concerns by FDA scientists about the company's results, including whether women with certain underlying medical conditions would understand that they shouldn't take the drug.The FDA's action only applies to Opill. It's in an older class of contraceptives, sometimes called minipills, that contain a single synthetic hormone and generally carry fewer side effects than more popular combination hormone pills.But women's health advocates hope the decision paves the way for more over-the-counter birth control options and, eventually, for abortion pills to do the same.An outside panel of FDA advisers unanimously voted in favour of the switch at a hearing in May where dozens of public speakers called for Opill's approval.WATCH | Renewed focus on abortion pills in wake of U.S. Supreme Court decision: Renewed focus on abortion pills in wake of U.S. Supreme Court decision1 year agoDuration 2:02Kate Kelly, with the advocacy group Shout Your Abortion, says multiple groups in the U.S. are working to educate people about the availability of abortion medication after Roe v. Wade was overturned.Dyvia Huitron was among those who presented, explaining how she has been unable to get prescription birth control more than three years after becoming sexually active.The 19-year-old University of Alabama student said she still isn't comfortable getting a prescription because the school's health system reports medical exams and medications to parents.\"My parents did not let me go on the pill,\" Huitron said in a recent interview. \"There was just a lot of cultural stigma around being sexually active before you're married.\"While she uses other forms of contraception, \"I would have much preferred to have birth control and use these additional methods to ensure that I was being as safe as possible.\"'Large' amount of data shows pill is safeAdvocates were particularly interested in Opill because it raised fewer safety concerns. The pill was first approved in the U.S. five decades ago.\"It's been around a long time, and we have a large amount of data supporting that this pill is safe and effective for over-the-counter use,\" Blanchard said.Newer birth control pills typically combine two hormones, estrogen and progestin, which can help make periods lighter and more regular. But their use carries a heightened risk of blood clots, and they shouldn't be used by women at risk for heart problems, such as those who smoke and are over 35.Opill has only progestin, which prevents pregnancy by blocking sperm from reaching the cervix. It must be taken around the same time daily to be most effective.In its internal review published in May, the FDA noted that some women in Perrigo's study had trouble understanding the drug's labelling information.In particular, the instructions warn that women with a history of breast cancer should not take the pill because it could spur tumour growth.Common side effects include bleeding, headaches, dizziness and cramps, according to the FDA. The label also cautions that certain drugs can interfere with Opill's effectiveness, including medications for seizures, HIV and hypertension.Perrigo executives said the company will spend the rest of the year manufacturing the pill so it can be available in stores early next year.\n",

            "The recall of a highly caffeinated energy drink is raising questions about how the cans of Prime Energy that violated Canada's health regulations got onto store shelves in the first place.The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) said Tuesday it is recalling cans of Prime Energy that contain 200 milligrams of caffeine after CBC News reported they were being sold in stores in at least three provinces. Health Canada's limit for such drinks is 180 milligrams of caffeine. Other brands of energy drinks are also part of the recall. One food law expert says, most often, items that violate Canada's health regulations were exported by foreign manufacturers who don't know the rules. \"[They might be] unaware of the limits of caffeine or is unaware that certain food additives are not harmonized,\" between Canada and the U.S., for example, said Glenford Jameson, a lawyer and partner at G.S. Jameson & Co. in Toronto. It would be up to a distributor to restrict the access, he says. Social media influencers Logan Paul and KSI meet fans during a Prime promotional event in Copenhagen, Denmark, on June 27. (REUTERS)But with e-commerce, that can get tricky. Jameson says big online retailers have struggled to follow regulations, but that the industry has seen improvements in making sure products follow each country's standards. Another common way is through a third country.A manufacturer might sell its product into another territory, where a distributor or merchant ends up exporting it to Canada, without letting the manufacturer know. \"They've created this product, [it's] deemed not to be safe or at least not compliant in Canada, yet it's arriving here, and so then how do they manage that?\" he said. \"It's a really difficult problem.\"  CBC News purchased a 200-milligram can of Prime Energy at a store in Montreal on Wednesday. Workers there said it was imported from the U.S. Prime said previously it \"complies with federal regulations\" in its markets but was unable to explain the presence of the drinks in Canada. The cans with 200 milligrams of caffeine are intended for the U.S. market. The company claims to have a Canadian version with 140 milligrams of caffeine. Prime did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday about the recall notice. 'Difficult to police'Jameson says, even though food and drinks are supposed to be regulated at the border, agencies often miss items.\"If you sort of picture the amount of goods that come into Canada on any given day, it's sort of difficult to police this sort of thing,\" he said. While the CFIA establishes the rules for food, drink, plants and similar products coming to Canada, it's the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) that enforces those requirements before the goods are released into Canada, according to the CBSA.The CFIA is \"is often quite reactive,\" said Jameson.\"They don't spend a lot of time patrolling shelves or rifling through boxes at the border,\" for lower-risk products like Prime Energy, he said. Food law expert Glenford Jameson says there are a number of ways items not eligible for sale in Canada can get into the country.  (Jennifer La Grassa/CBC)Dr. Jane Shearer, a kinesiology professor at the University of Calgary, says caffeine shouldn't be under the CFIA purview because it's a drug.\"It's highly problematic,\" she said. \"I think energy drink companies have been largely in charge here and the Canadian government needs to do more on getting a handle on what's in the market. This is not the first time we've seen products in the market that exceed Health Canada regulations.\"Health Canada's recommended maximum caffeine intake for children up to age 18 is 2.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, per day. For adults, it's no more than 400 milligrams. Coffee can sometimes have more than 180 milligrams of caffeine in a single serving, and is not as strictly regulated. But experts say the concern with energy drinks is how they're marketed and whether it's to vulnerable demographics. \"It's framed as being fun, it's framed as being kind of trendy, it's framed as being healthy and it's framed also as optimizing your performance, when all it really is is water with caffeine in it,\" said Timothy Caulfield, Canada research chair in health law and policy at the University of Alberta. Timothy Caulfield is the Canada Research Chair in Health Law and Policy at the University of Alberta.  (David MacIntosh/CBC)\"So I think it makes sense [that] regulators watch products like this to ensure that their claims are justified.\" Consumer safety advocate Jim Shepherd agrees that the branding and marketing of these drinks attracts a younger demographic who could be unaware of the health consequences. That's why he wants Canada to ban the sale of all energy drinks to people under 18. Shepherd, who lives in Toronto, believes that his son Brian's consumption of a caffeinated energy drink caused the 15-year-old's death in 2008. An autopsy found that Brian experienced an acute arrhythmic event following a paintball match. The only drug in his system was caffeine, according to Shepherd. Brian Shepherd died in 2008 when he was 15 years old. His dad says he collapsed after a paintball match.  (Submitted by Jim Shepherd)It wasn't until months after Brian's death that Shepherd said he was told an energy drink company had attended the match and gave out samples of the drink, which his son consumed. Since then, he's been advocating for better regulations. \"There's been some changes, but it's 100 per cent not enough,\" he said. \"They really haven't properly protected … youth and children. I really don't care if an adult drinks the drinks, as long as they're aware and I think that's the part that's key is most of them are not aware.\"Over the years, research has shown that these sorts of drinks can have bad health effects on people. This review of recent research says that energy drinks can create anxiety, insomnia, irregular heart rhythms and sometimes death. Shepherd says he wants to see the CFIA become more proactive and issue more penalties to bad players. Highly caffeinated version of Prime Energy drink ordered recalled by federal governmentThe FDA says people are confusing poppers with energy shots, and dying. Experts want proofWhat science says about the risks of energy drinks\"Unless somebody complains about it if it's wrong, it's not going to get corrected,\" he said, adding that even when he's filed complaints he hasn't seen proper retribution. Shepherd says he's been following the buzz created by Prime and knew it was a matter of time before it came to Canada. \"My major concern is with the kids,\" he said. \"There isn't awareness from a lot of parents to know what the potential danger that these drinks are.\" WATCH | Canadian regulator recalls several highly caffeinated energy drinks: Highly caffeinated version of the Prime Energy recalled in Canada6 days agoDuration 2:14The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is recalling a highly caffeinated version of the Prime Energy drink that is not approved for sale in Canada after discovering it was being sold in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta.\n",

            "Vishal Gentle isn't the avid gym-goer he was before his daughter was born a few months ago.But the new dad said he does what he can to stay active — carrying the baby up and down stairs to get a bit of a workout, lots of walking and using a stand-up desk. Gentle said he feels healthy, but according to the body mass index, or BMI, he's overweight.\"Honestly, I don't feel overweight. I mean, except a little bit near my waist. But like I'm fully active. I can do anything and everything,\" he said during an interview in his Toronto home. Gentle isn't alone when it comes to questioning if his BMI is an accurate way of measuring health. The BMI is under growing scrutiny — both for its usefulness as a measure of health and its problematic origins.THE DOSEWhy a top Canadian obesity expert doesn't use BMI'It's not your fault': Changing the conversation about obesityBMI is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in metres squared. The result can be compared to the BMI chart, easily found all over the internet, social media and in doctors' offices, that instantly advises the user if their result is underweight, normal, overweight or obese.Last month, the American Medical Association (AMA) formally recognized BMI's shortcomings and created a new policy advising caution when using it. In a news release in June, the AMA warned that the BMI is an \"imperfect way to measure body fat in multiple groups given that it does not account for differences across race/ethnic groups, sexes, genders, and age-span.\"WATCH | The problem with BMI: Using BMI to assess your health can be misleading, experts warn12 days agoDuration 2:03The American Medical Association warns BMI or body mass index can be a misleading health indicator, and some health-care experts instead favour things like waist circumference. Health Canada still promotes BMI on its website but says the tool is imperfect.It also notes that the BMI, which dates back to the 19th century, has a problematic foundation.\"Under the newly adopted policy, the AMA recognizes issues with using BMI as a measurement due to its historical harm, its use for racist exclusion, and because BMI is based primarily on data collected from previous generations of non-Hispanic white populations,\" the news release states.The AMA encouraged clinicians to use other factors such as waist circumference, fat distribution and genetic factors when assessing a patient's health. Growing criticismThe AMA's position is the latest in mounting criticism of the BMI. The inability to distinguish between mass created by fat, muscle and bone has been noted as a shortcoming by experts and health authorities, as is the lack of distinction for where fat is distributed on the body. They note abdomen fat can be a risk factor for conditions like diabetes and heart disease, while hip and thigh fat is less associated with health issues.Dr. Sanjeev Sockalingam is the scientific director of Obesity Canada. The organization's latest practice guidelines leave BMI out of the definition of obesity. (Obesity Canada)Dr. Sanjeev Sockalingam, the Toronto-based scientific director of Obesity Canada, said he hopes the AMA's position accelerates work to find better ways for assessing health, and specifically for evaluating obesity as a medical condition. \"I'm hoping that this will actually spawn a bit more research as well in this area, which I think is much needed given all the challenges and issues that we've identified with BMI,\" he said.Obesity Canada's latest practice guidelines leave BMI out of the definition of obesity, and instead describe it as a chronic medical condition that results in disability and impairment.Why has the BMI stuck around?Still, BMI calculators are easily found on websites for organizations like the Canadian Cancer Society and Diabetes Canada.Health Canada promotes use of BMI and has the chart on its website, but notes the measure shouldn't be used by people under age 18, or those who are pregnant or lactating. The agency has recommended using BMI along with measuring waist circumference since 2003, spokesperson Nicholas Janveau said in an email.\"While BMI has some limitations, it still tends to be the preferred measure of excess body fat for population-level surveillance and epidemiologic studies because of its simplicity and the ease with which it can be estimated,\" Janveau said.New obesity guidelines shift focus to root causes rather than weight lossObesity rates: Is the Body Mass Index a good measurement?Despite all of Sockalingam's misgivings about BMI, he said it can't be abandoned just yet because it's deeply integrated into clinical trials and other aspects of health care.\"We don't want to remove it right now without anything to replace it because it's been so difficult to get people to recognize obesity as a chronic medical condition and to think about patient-centred approaches and treatments that are now emerging for people living with obesity,\" he said.He advises people to think of BMI as a high-level screening tool, but not to rely on it for diagnosing an individual.What's the alternative?Dr. Sonia Anand, a vascular medicine specialist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ont., said she agrees that it would be difficult to untangle BMI from its place in clinical settings, research and the weight-loss industry.She knows it won't go away any time soon, but said she'd like to see it replaced by waist circumference as the go-to free, simple measurement.\"It is entrenched in our way of thinking. But it is now reasonable, a good time for different health-care practitioners, agencies, trialists and individuals to start measuring waist circumference and use that together with body weight,\" Anand said.Dr. Sonia Anand, a vascular medicine specialist at McMaster University, says continuing to rely on BMI for people with different backgrounds and lifestyles means risking missing signs to test for metabolic changes. (Turgut Yeter/CBC)Anand has done research into how South Asian people experience metabolic changes such as increases in blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol at a lower cut off point than white Europeans do.She said continuing to rely on BMI for people with different backgrounds and lifestyles means risking missing signs to test for metabolic changes, or could lead to a person with a lot of muscle mass and a high BMI being wrongly advised to lose weight. By itself, waist circumference isn't the gold standard in assessing health, either, Anand said, but she added it does a better job of assessing whether someone has excess body fat in a specific area that can increase the risk of health issues.A holistic approachWhen it comes to diagnosing and treating obesity, Sockalingam said he would like to see more holistic assessment.\"Ultimately we want to look at how obesity is impacting an individual in terms of their day-to-day living, their functioning and their co-occurring conditions, whether it be physical or mental health,\" he said.Anand and Sockalingam agree that even if discontent with BMI as a measurement of health grows, it'll take quite a while for widespread change to happen. Sockalingam said he hopes that people who hear about the problems with BMI will be empowered to ask their health-care practitioners for different kinds of assessments. Cape Breton clinic helping patients deal with causes of obesityTHE CURRENTCanadians are taking Ozempic, but stigma around weight stops them talking about itVishal Gentle said he has had those conversations with his family doctor in Toronto, who told him he's not overweight.He said it's important to him to keep a close eye on his health because his father died at age 67 during cardiac arrest. Gentle said his father carried weight on his belly and so his doctor's advice to focus on eating well, exercising and keeping an eye on waist circumference makes sense to him. \"As long as I'm able to feel good and carry on my day-to-day, I have no issues,\" he said.\n",

            "The country's national vaccine advisers are recommending Canadians get another COVID-19 booster shot this fall, with updated vaccines expected in the months ahead.The next round of vaccines will likely be monovalent — meaning they will specifically target the Omicron family of sub-lineages that are still circulating globally, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) said Tuesday.\"An additional dose using the latest vaccine formulations will be an important tool to not only build back protection against severe disease that wanes over time, but also protect against currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants,\" Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said in a statement.\"This additional dose is especially important for those at increased risk of COVID-19 infection or severe disease.\"Back in May, a World Health Organization advisory group suggested it would be ideal to focus on a monovalent shot targeting XBB.1 and its offshoots, rather than a bivalent vaccine targeting both new and old strains of the coronavirus, which was the booster last rolled out in Canada.\"Manufacturers have indicated that new COVID-19 vaccine formulations are in development and products are forthcoming,\" Canada's vaccine advisers wrote, adding that booster doses expected for the fall will be \"updated to target more recent, immune-evasive SARS-CoV-2 variants.\" WATCH | Meet the scientists tracking new COVID variants before its too late: The scientists tracking new COVID-19 variants — before it’s too late7 months agoDuration 2:19The virus that causes COVID-19 continues to mutate amid reduced testing, adding to concerns that a new variant could explode before it's detected and tracked. But Canadian labs are on the case.The mRNA-based vaccines remain the preferred COVID-19 vaccine product, the recommendations continued.Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, says the recommendations from NACI were expected. \"People have thought really carefully about ... what's going to give us the best protection.\"But McGeer said this advice could still change depending on the disease trajectory, level of infection and whether any new strains arise in the next few months. Who should get vaccinated — and when? NACI's new guidance states that Canadians should wait to get a booster at least six months after a previous vaccine dose or a known SARS-CoV-2 infection — whichever came later. That's because research suggests the shots are more effective when they're spaced out from an active infection or prior vaccination, as CBC News has previously reported.AnalysisWhat the end of the COVID emergency means for CanadaOne Canadian study, for instance, suggests protection against infection from two doses of the Pfizer vaccine spikes when the first and second shots are spread out, from roughly 80 per cent after a few weeks to more than 90 per cent after four months.While NACI advises that everyone should get a dose of a new vaccine, it specifically advises that people at a higher risk of severe disease get the booster dose. Vulnerable groups at higher risk include: Adults 65 years and older. Long-term care and congregate living residents. People with underlying medical conditions that put them at higher risk of severe disease. People who are pregnant.First Nations, Métis and Inuit people.People from racialized and other equity-deserving communities. People who provide essential community services. Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist with the University Health Network in Toronto, agreed that ongoing vaccination remains essential for those at-risk groups.\"The challenge is: What does everyone else do? It's clear who's at risk of greater infection … but what do you do for everybody else?\" he said. \"One of the challenges that's going to be faced is uptake of vaccination in the other groups. Are people going to be coming out for that booster vaccine?\"AnalysisWhy most Canadians don't need another COVID-19 booster — at least not yet More targeted communication strategies will be useful going forward to reach people of varying risk levels, Bogoch added. Federal figures show the vast majority of Canadians have been vaccinated against COVID-19 so far, with more than 80 per cent of the population completing their primary shots. But interest in getting additional shots has dropped over time — with less than six per cent of Canadians receiving a booster dose, or completing their primary series, within the last six months.Protection from vaccination, infection decreases 'over time'NACI continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination for anyone who hasn't yet been immunized, including individuals older than five and children six months to five years of age. The currently available bivalent vaccines can be used for a primary vaccine series for either age group, the advisers noted.NACI also noted the higher levels of protection against severe disease provided by hybrid immunity — when people have been both vaccinated and previously infected — as opposed to just vaccination or a prior infection alone. COVID-19 booster shots recommended for high-risk Canadians starting this spring\"For this reason, an additional dose of vaccine starting this fall is particularly important for those who have not been previously infected and have protection from vaccination alone,\" the guidance said. \"However, even with hybrid immunity, protection against infection will decrease over time and the duration of protection against severe disease varies between studies and is unknown in the context of currently circulating variants.\"WATCH | World Health Organization ends COVID emergency: COVID-19 pandemic no longer a 'global health emergency'2 months agoDuration 2:03The World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 is no longer a 'global health emergency' but with strained health systems and continued elevated deaths, the virus remains a concern.While people might be fatigued with getting COVID-19 shots, McGeer said it's important to remember that \"you will be less likely to get ill and less likely to die if you choose to get vaccinated.\" When it comes to whether new COVID-19 vaccinations will continue to be offered year after year, similar to the flu, McGeer said it's \"too early to tell.\" Is another wave coming?While it's unclear whether Canada will see an increase in COVID-19 cases come the fall, NACI says that it's usually a time when other respiratory illnesses are on the rise, like the flu and RSV. \"We know there's going to be more COVID on the horizon in the fall and winter months,\" Bogoch said.World Health Organization updates variant names to track Omicron's rapid evolutionAs a result, NACI advises that people get vaccinated to protect those who are vulnerable to other illnesses and to prevent the health-care system from becoming overwhelmed. In the latest recommendations, the committee says that modelling predicts a fall vaccination dose could \"prevent thousands of hospitalizations and deaths across the country\" over the next year. It's unclear when exactly the new doses will be made available, but NACI says that it will continue to review the latest information on the vaccine and provide updated recommendations as needed. \n",

            "Despite a majority of wastewater sites across the country reporting some of the lowest levels of COVID-19 since analysis began, some researchers say this type of surveillance should continue so Canada can be prepared for the next pandemic.Wastewater surveillance gained prominence in recent years by providing health officials with a summary of the degree of disease among Canadians during peaks in the pandemic. But its value beyond the coronavirus was quickly realized as a crucial public health tool that could help protect people from future harmful infections.Of the 39 sites tracked by Canada's COVID-19 wastewater surveillance dashboard, recent data shows that about 60 per cent are reporting decreasing levels of the virus. The rest of the sites are stable or slightly lower than their previous readings.\"In the past, I would say, several weeks, we've seen a relatively consistent downward trend,\" said Dr. Guillaume Poliquin, vice-president of the National Microbiology Laboratory, part of the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).Wastewater reporting began in 2020, not long after the pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization, with more sites added as it continued.Even though the amount of the virus at many of PHAC's sites appears to be at its lowest point since reporting began, Poliquin said it comes with a caveat.Dr. Guillaume Poliquin, vice-president of the Public Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory, says ongoing conversations are taking place and work is being done to sustain and expand the wastewater surveillance system. (CBC)\"The techniques that are used, how accurate they are, how sensitive they are, has generally been getting better over time,\" he said.\"Monitoring has changed over time. It's not all the time comparable, but the trend is certainly reassuring.\"Second OpinionFor virus tracking, wastewater is liquid gold. Scientists hope that work isn't flushed awayIt became apparent during the pandemic that COVID-19 levels will fluctuate based on the time of year. Disease spread tends to be lower in the warm summer months, with one reason being that people spend more time outdoors.At the same time, 80.5 per cent of Canadians are fully vaccinated against the virus and more than 4.6 million have been infected, according to PHAC data — although its website notes that due to changes in testing, the number of cases might actually be higher.How important is surveillance?The practice of gathering wastewater from different communities and analyzing it for COVID-19 is a public health tool that researchers have said is useful to predict disease trends and support decisions around public health policies. But it's also a strong indicator of what's to come, as experts can see whether a new strain of the virus has emerged.Initially, 21 per cent of Canada's population was being monitored, but it's now grown to more than 60 per cent across the country, Poliquin said.Survey results published last month in The Lancet journal show that Canada was one of the top countries, among 43 that participated, whose wastewater surveillance efforts covered the majority of the population. The article goes on to emphasize how significant this sort of testing tool has proven to track current and emerging health threats.People receive a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at a mass vaccination clinic at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto on June 27, 2021. The pandemic was recently downgraded from global emergency status. (Cole Burston/The Canadian Press)Although the COVID-19 pandemic was recently downgraded from global emergency status, continued wastewater surveillance is still very important, said Eric Arts, Canada Research Chair in viral pathogenesis and control at Western University in London, Ont.\"It's too easy for the general public to see it and say, 'Well, [COVID-19] is no longer here, so why are we bothering with this?' And it's getting the information out that says ... 'You don't listen to the weatherman most of the time, but when you see a storm rolling in, you really wish you would have listened,'\" Arts said in an interview with CBC News.\"It's preparing our health-care system for an impending wave.\"Whether that's a new subvariant of COVID-19 or a range of other infectious diseases, Arts said advance warning could help the health-care system get ahead by rolling out protections and preventative measures.Wastewater could indicate next pandemicThe federal government is also routinely monitoring wastewater for polio, mpox (formerly known as monkeypox), the flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).But Arts said he's most interested in using wastewater to get ahead of the unknown.\"[There are] new pathogens that might jump into the human population that we're not fully aware of,\" he said.But if scientists don't know what they're looking for, how will they be able to tell it's in the wastewater?This graph shows the standardized concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in Ontario's wastewater systems. Across Canada, the provinces and territories actively monitoring their wastewater for COVID-19 all display it in different ways, making it hard to draw comparative conclusions across each region. Creating a national strategy would help with the way this data is presented, researchers say.  (Public Health Ontario)\"There's rapid advancement in technologies, and we can now monitor things that are novel and that are coming into the population, as long as we maintain these surveillance programs,\" he said.Arts said he's part of a program that is looking at a way to monitor all of the possible strains of coronaviruses and influenza viruses that have the potential to infect humans.\"The tools we have at hand make the surveillance of those tens of thousands of strains actually not that difficult and not that cost prohibitive,\" he said.Ontario's COVID-19 wastewater testing program gets an $18M boostNorovirus, the culprit behind a nasty stomach bug, is rising again in Canada\"So when something does appear that shouldn't be in human wastewater, we can say, 'Hmm, that's something to keep an eye on,' and then alert the public health agencies.\"Governments and health officials, he said, could prepare vaccines for these other possibly infectious strains and have them on hand to mass produce should a pandemic arise.But there is some concern among those in the wastewater surveillance field that despite how essential this new technology is, monitoring could be cut if governments tighten their budgets.Will monitoring continue?The federal government's national wastewater monitoring system currently works with local researchers and labs to collect information from key sites. Additionally, some provinces and territories are funding their own efforts to monitor wastewater at a more local level.At this time, there's no requirement for provinces to collect this data, nor is there any firm national strategy around a standardized procedure or collaborative database to hold this information.Wastewater researchers are calling on Ottawa to create a national strategy that will consolidate this data and better inform the country's public health status.WATCH | Wastewater helps scientists track infectious diseases: Wastewater helps scientists track infectious diseases10 months agoDuration 3:21The COVID-19 pandemic showed scientists how useful wastewater could be to track infectious diseases, now it’s being used to help identify other outbreaks including monkeypox and polio.While Poliquin, of the National Microbiology Laboratory, said he doesn't have a \"definitive\" answer on the next steps for this surveillance system, he told CBC News that ongoing conversations are taking place and work is being done to sustain and expand it.\"The technology has proven its value,\" he said. \"There's a lot of potential here, and now that the network and infrastructure has been put in place, we are looking to continue to support it.\"Wastewater surveillance provides crucial COVID data, but also carries privacy concerns: scientistsPoliquin said the scale of it is also cost-effective, with an individual PCR test costing $50 to $100 a person and a wastewater sample test costing $100 to $200.In order for a national strategy to be effective, Arts said, the government needs to get all public health agencies on board, look at standardizing the procedure across the country and ensure that it consolidates the work out of specific centres. Border surveillance top priority, say researchersBut if governments decide to scale back this type of warning system, researchers say it's most important to keep monitoring Canada's points of entry, such as borders and airports.\"Twenty-five to 30 per cent of Canada-U.S. trade crosses the border at Windsor-Detroit, making it the strategic location to place resources to be monitoring for diseases emerging in the country,\" said Mike McKay, executive director of the Great Lakes Institute for Environmental Research (GLIER) at the University of Windsor, in Windsor, Ont.Mike McKay, executive director of the Great Lakes Institute for Environmental Research at the University of Windsor, says Canada's borders are an important place to continue wastewater surveillance for any incoming illnesses. (Dale Molnar/CBC)McKay, who has been monitoring the wastewater in southwestern Ontario and parts of the United States since the early months of the pandemic, said this type of surveillance will also help the private sector so that supply chains become more resilient.He said GLIER is working alongside groups at the University of Guelph, University of Waterloo, York University and University of Toronto to pitch a cross-border surveillance program to the federal government.ExclusiveCanada to start testing some wastewater for polio 'as soon as possible'This would include monitoring in Ohio, Michigan and into Windsor, as well as the Fort Erie, Ont., and Buffalo, N.Y., areas, he said.The application will be submitted by September, and Ottawa is expected to to make a decision early next year.

            "Starting this fall, teens in England will get just one HPV shot — making it the latest country to drop the number of required doses for the highly effective vaccines known for protecting against a slate of cancers.The World Health Organization (WHO) announced more than a year ago that a single dose delivers \"solid protection\" against human papillomavirus (HPV) that's comparable to two or three shots, based on a growing body of global evidence. Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Australia have already made the switch. And many researchers say providing fewer doses can free up much-needed resources for other public health efforts.So, should Canada follow other countries' lead by taking a one-dose approach? There's no decision here just yet.The country's top vaccination advisers are looking at \"all the available evidence\" while conducting their own analysis based on Canadian disease rates and modelling projections, a spokesperson for the Public Health Agency of Canada told CBC News. That work is \"expected to be finalized next year.\"Cervical cancer could be eliminated in next century, international study findsCurrently, Canadian guidelines suggest that healthy kids aged nine to 15 should get one of the available HPV vaccines on either a two or three-dose schedule. The current chair of Quebec's immunization committee, Dr. Caroline Quach — who chaired the National Advisory Commitee on Immunization (NACI) during much of the COVID-19 pandemic — is among the Canadian medical experts who say Canada should consider following the lead of England and other countries.One dose effectiveness 'quite high'\"When you look at the studies that have been published worldwide ... the effectiveness of one dose of the HPV vaccine is actually quite high,\" Quach said. \"In terms of prevention of HPV infections that may lead to cancer, whether you give one dose or two doses basically gives you the same amount of protection.\"Fewer in-school HPV vaccinations could cause rise in preventable cancers, doctors warnResearch from India and Costa Rica has shown the durability of one dose of certain types of HPV vaccines lasts a decade, noted the U.K.'s vaccine advisory committee.The U.K. also looked at a more recent trial in Kenya, which was also meant to study the effectiveness of a single dose. That research found young girls and women were effectively protected from HPV infection for 18 months post-vaccination — with vaccine efficacy at more than 97 per cent, keeping the results in line with trials for three doses.Study finds HPV vaccine should lead to significant decrease in cervical cancer in 10 years\"Every country and every advisory committee needs to review the data and look at the modelling, the epidemiology of their own country,\" Quach said. \"But it's absolutely something that we have to look at.\"WATCH | Concern over lagging HPV vaccination rates for kids: Calls for schools, pharmacies to boost lagging HPV vaccination rates for kids1 year agoDuration 2:03Medical experts are concerned about the impact of missed HPV vaccinations in kids due to pandemic school closures. They want schools and pharmacies to step up and ensure kids get their HPV vaccinations to protect them against cancer later in life.Dawn Bowdish, an immunologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, said she feels a cautious approach is more prudent, to gauge whether a reduced number of required doses maintains decades-long protection.Most childhood vaccines need multiple doses to sufficiently train the immune system to recognize a threat in the long term,  she added. And even with less HPV circulating now in Canada thanks to years of HPV vaccination efforts, she said the country remains in a \"delicate spot.\"\"The tide can turn very quickly if we lose the advantage of vaccination,\" Bowdish warned. \"We haven't eliminated this virus — it is ready to come back and find vulnerable people again.\"It can prevent cervical cancer. So why aren't more women getting the HPV vaccine for free?Quach, however, stressed that if Canada goes the one-dose route, robust surveillance programs would pick up early warning signs if the approach falls short, suggesting the country should reverse course and offer catch-up shots.And both agree there's a key element to the entire discussion around the ideal number of doses: money.\"The gamble that the U.K. is making is that one dose will be sufficient ... but they felt that the cost benefit was worth it,\" Bowdish said. \"It would be cheaper to administer one dose, and easier than getting someone to come back three times.\"HPV vaccine cuts rates of cervical pre-cancer by 57% in B.C. womenThe resources freed up from the upcoming move to one dose can be redirected, \"improving our already high vaccine coverage levels and ensuring that anyone who misses their dose still has other opportunities to receive it,\" Mark Jit, an epidemiologist with the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in England and a member of the Single Dose HPV Vaccine Consortium, said in a statement.On a global level, advocates also say that lowering the number of needed doses could be a massive cost-saving measure for vaccinating populations in lower- and middle-income countries.WATCH | Kids behind on shots after pandemic school closures: Kids behind on vaccinations after pandemic school closures, survey shows11 months agoDuration 2:10School-aged children in Ontario are way behind on routine vaccinations partly due to pandemic-related school closures, new research from the University of Toronto shows.High costs for adults who want the shotsBut what the shift wouldn't solve here in Canada are the sky-high costs adults face when they age out of government vaccination programs.In Ontario, for instance, students in Grade 7 can get the HPV vaccine for free. Public health clinics also typically offer the shots for free to students up to Grade 12, and gay, bisexual and trans men up to the age of 26.P.E.I. replaces Pap tests with HPV tests to detect cervical cancerOther young adults who want the shots, but aren't eligible for free programs, can spend roughly $600 on three required doses, said London, Ont., resident Gillian Cameron, an advocate for broader HPV vaccine access. (The vaccines can be purchased privately with a prescription, and may be covered by some insurance providers.)Cameron is now calling on the Ontario government to provide free HPV shots to everyone under the age of 26 — and more than 30,000 people have signed her online petition so far.LEARNING CURVE'We are behind a lot': How provinces are catching kids up on routine vaccines\"It was kind of a question, like, are you going to pay for your phone bill this month? Are you going to pay for groceries? Or are you going to get this vaccine?\" she said.That's a choice no Canadian should have to make, Cameron added, given the overwhelming evidence that these shots save lives by preventing infections that can lead to potentially deadly cervical, anal, and head and neck cancers.Gillian Cameron of London, Ont., is lobbying the Ontario government to make the HPV vaccine more widely available. (Submitted by Gillian Cameron)An HPV vaccine was first recommended in the U.S. back in 2006, and in the 10 years following, quadrivalent type HPV infections decreased by 86 per cent in female teens aged 14 to 19 years, and more than 71 per cent in women in their early 20s, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.And on the cancer front, a U.K. study published in the Lancet in 2021 found cervical cancer rates were 87 per cent lower in young women who had been eligible for HPV vaccination when they were aged 12 to 13 years, compared with young women who had not been offered vaccination.While NACI continues assessing the ideal number of doses, there is international consensus regarding the astounding overall success of these vaccines.\"The fact that we have a vaccine that can prevent cancer ... how amazing is that?\" Bowdish said.\n",

            "U.S. officials granted full approval to a closely watched Alzheimer's drug on Thursday, clearing the way for Medicare and other insurance plans to begin covering the treatment for people with the brain-robbing disease.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) endorsed the IV drug, Leqembi, for patients with mild dementia and other symptoms caused by early Alzheimer's disease. It's the first medicine that's been convincingly shown to modestly slow the cognitive decline caused by Alzheimer's.Japanese drug-maker Eisai received conditional approval from the FDA in January based on early results suggesting Leqembi worked by clearing a sticky brain plaque linked to the disease.The FDA confirmed those results by reviewing data from a larger, 1,800-patient study in which the drug slowed memory and thinking decline by about five months in those who got the treatment, compared to those who got a dummy drug.U.S. approves Leqembi, a drug that modestly slows Alzheimer's\"This confirmatory study verified that it is a safe and effective treatment for patients with Alzheimer's disease,\" said FDA's neurology drug director, Dr. Teresa Buracchio, in a statement.The drug's prescribing information will carry the most serious type of warning, indicating that Leqembi can cause brain swelling and bleeding, side effects that can be dangerous in rare cases. The label notes that those problems are seen with other plaque-targeting Alzheimer's drugs.Leqembi is not approved in Canada, though clinical trials have been run in Toronto. This Dec. 21, 2022 image provided by Eisai in January 2023, shows vials and packaging for their medication Leqembi. On Friday, Jan. 6, 2023, U.S. health officials approved Leqembi, a new Alzheimer’s drug that modestly slows the brain-robbing disease. The Food and Drug Administration granted the approval Friday for patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's. (Eisai via AP) (Eisai/The Associated Press)Drug costs more than $26K for one yearThe process of converting a drug to full FDA approval usually attracts little attention. But Alzheimer's patients and advocates have been lobbying the federal government for months after Medicare officials announced last year they wouldn't pay for routine use of drugs like Leqembi until they receive FDA's full approval.There were concerns that the cost of new plaque-targeting Alzheimer's drugs could overwhelm the program's finances, which provide care for 60 million seniors. Leqembi is priced at about $26,500 for a year's supply of IVs every two weeks.The vast majority of Americans with Alzheimer's get their health coverage through Medicare. And private insurers have followed its lead by withholding coverage for Leqembi and a similar drug, Aduhelm, until they receive FDA's full endorsement.WATCH: New Alzheimer's drug met with hope and cautionHope and anxiety surround new Alzheimer’s drug lecanemab8 months agoDuration 3:43Two pharmaceutical companies say a drug they’ve developed has the potential to slow the progression of Alzheimer’s, something no treatment has been able to do. Now, researchers and those impacted by the disease are anxiously awaiting the full results of a human trial for the medication.An FDA decision on full approval for Aduhelm is still years away.Medicare administrator, Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, said in a statement Thursday the program will begin paying for the drug now that it has full FDA approval. But the government is also setting extra requirements, including enrolment in a federal registry to track the drug's real-world safety and effectiveness. Medicare \"will cover this medication broadly while continuing to gather data that will help us understand how the drug works,\" Brooks-LaSure said.Some Medicare patients could be responsible for paying the standard 20 per cent of the cost of Leqembi, though the amount will vary depending on their plans and other coverage details.Hospitals and medical clinics have cautioned that it may take time to get people started on the drug. 2nd clinical trials for promising Alzheimer's drug to take place at U of Sask.Doctors need to confirm that patients have the brain plaque targeted by Leqembi before prescribing it. Nurses need to be trained to administer the drug and patients must be monitored with repeated brain scans to check for swelling or bleeding.The imaging and administration services carry extra costs for hospitals beyond the drug itself.Eisai has told investors that about 100,000 Americans could be diagnosed and eligible to receive Leqembi by 2026. The drug is co-marketed with Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Biogen.\"We want to ensure that appropriate patients only are the ones that get this product,\" said Alexander Scott, a vice president with Eisai.Eisai studied the drug in people with early or mild disease who were evaluated using a scale measuring memory, thinking and other basic skills. After 18 months, those who got Leqembi declined more slowly — a difference of less than half a point on the scale — than participants who received a dummy infusion.Some Alzheimer's experts say that delay is likely too subtle for patients or their families to notice.But federal health advisers said the difference could still be meaningful and recommended that FDA fully approve the drug at a public meeting in June.\n",
